\alias{resolve_duplicate}
\title{Resolve duplicated rows of a data frame}
\usage{
resolve_duplicate(x, var_duplicated)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame}

\item{var_duplicated}{variable that should be unique but that has potential duplicated values and thus need to be solved}
}
\description{
Resolve duplicated values of \code{var_duplicated} by removing \code{NA} values from other variables of the data frame \code{x} and merging similar values.
}
\note{
Throw a warning if one of the other column can't be reduced because of different, non \code{NA}, values. The value is then merged by collapsing the values.
}
