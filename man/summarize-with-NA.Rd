\usage{
last_na(x, na_rm = FALSE)

any_na(x, na_rm = FALSE)

first_na(x, na_rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector}

\item{na_rm}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, \code{\link{na.omit}} is performed first. Default to \code{FALSE}}
}
\description{
All these functions performs the same as the basic version but differ when all elements are \code{NA}. In this case, \code{NA} is returned in the same format as \code{x}, which is not always the case when the basic function is used with \code{\link[dplyr]{summarize}}.
